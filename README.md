    We live in a world where technology is advancing rapidly, yet we often forget the most important thing — respect for one another. <br /> 
    Developers working with different stacks sometimes view others with prejudice or even disdain. <br />
    It’s disheartening because technologies are merely tools, not reasons to divide us. <br />

    <h3>My Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Respect everyone, regardless of the tools or approaches they use.</li>
      <li>Stay open to new knowledge and constantly strive for growth.</li>
      <li>Laziness? It’s the driving force of automation, but let’s not let it overshadow common sense.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I believe we can create amazing things by supporting one another and merging the best ideas from different technological worlds.
